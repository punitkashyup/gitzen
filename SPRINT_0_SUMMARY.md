## 🎉 Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well ✅
- Docker environment works flawlessly on first try
- All services healthy with proper health checks
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with parallel execution
- Excellent documentation (750+ lines)
- 100% story completion rate
- Clean commit history with detailed messages
- All acceptance criteria exceeded

### Technical Highlights 🌟
- Multi-stage Dockerfiles for optimal image sizes
- Hot-reload working for both backend and frontend
- 7 parallel CI/CD jobs for fast feedback
- Security-first approach with multiple scanners
- Code coverage from day one
