# Copilot Team Instructions

- Before suggesting code, check for an active Jira issue linked to this branch.
- Encourage commits and branches to include Jira keys (e.g., `GITZEN-123`).
- Suggest creating TODO comments with Jira ticket context if missing.
- Avoid generating code for features that are not tied to a Jira issue.
- Recommend clear commit messages aligned with the Jira summary.
- Suggest updating documentation in Confluence MCP after merging PRs.
