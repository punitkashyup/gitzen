# Copilot Team Instructions

- Before suggesting code, check for an active Jira issue linked to this branch.
- Encourage commits and branches to include Jira keys (e.g., `GITZEN-123`).
- Suggest creating TODO comments with Jira ticket context if missing.
- Avoid generating code for features that are not tied to a Jira issue.
- Recommend clear commit messages aligned with the Jira summary.
- Suggest updating documentation in Confluence MCP after merging PRs.
- Follow a modular and global variable approach for design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) to ensure consistency across all pages.  
- Maintain a modern, clean, and user-friendly UI/UX with a focus on accessibility and responsive design.  
- Ensure all UI components follow a consistent design pattern and align with the global color palette.  
- Prefer reusable components over duplicate code to promote maintainability and scalability.
